# apples2apples: [Apples 2 Apples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_to_Apples) in Google App Engine

I wanted to learn more about the [Google App Engine Channel API](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/channel/)
so I created a card game.

## Usage

Download the source and add it as a new project to the Google App Engine launcher.
Run the project and connect at least 3 different web browsers to the same running project.
If you are a player, choose a card to play, if you are the judge, select a played card that you think is best.
